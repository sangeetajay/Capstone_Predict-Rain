# Capstone Project for Springboard Data Science Career Track

## Using Machine Learning to Predict Rain


This folder contains the notebooks and final reports for my capstone project. The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)


1. Notebooks:

    [Data Wrangling and EDA: ](https://github.com/sangeetajay/Capstone_Predict-Rain/blob/main/DataWrangling_EDA_Rain.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook containing the data wrangling, cleanup of dataset, and exploratory data analysis.
    
    [Pre-Processing and Modeling: ](https://github.com/sangeetajay/Capstone_Predict-Rain/blob/main/PreProcessing_Modeling_Rain.ipynb) Jupyter notebook containing the pre-processing of the data and the modeling. Four supervised machine learning models were tested in this notebook.

2. Documentation:
